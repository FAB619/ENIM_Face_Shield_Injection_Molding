# What?
<hr />
It is one of the first urgent actions to combat the spread of the virus.
The request was made, first, by the medical profession and then relayed by the public authorities.





# Why?
<hr />
Visor masks are useful for medical personnel and also for all service agents likely to be confronted with a risk of contamination (cleaning agents, firefighters, etc.)


# How?
<hr />
In a first phase, the group in charge of this project carried out the design and manufacture of visor masks by laser cutting (for a good rate compared to 3d printing - Manufacturing time: 2 minutes) and using plates of plexiglass.
In order to increase the production rate of these visor masks, a reflection was carried out to choose the optimal manufacturing process. The team in charge of this project opted for plastic injection manufacturing. We are aiming to manufacture 10,000 additional pieces. A first injection mold was designed and manufactured by the means of ENIM.
