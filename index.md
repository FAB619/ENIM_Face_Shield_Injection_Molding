# What? 

---

HappyShield is a new **open-source** design for a **simple, foldable face shield** for infection control developed **in response to the Covid-19 pandemic**. 

**_Please note: HappyShield has not yet been certified for use as personal protective equipment._**

---

# Why?

---

Healthcare workers need face shields in addition to masks and goggles to provide protection from splashes and sprays of infected bodily fluids from Covid-19 patients during a number of high-risk medical procedures and situations. There is currently a **significant shortage of face shields globally**, which is likely to be **particularly severe in less wealthy regions** without the ability to buy or manufacture necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as easily or quickly as wealthy countries. 

---

# How? 

---

The aim of this project is to develop a set of designs for face shields which are **safe**, **cheap**, **easy to mass-produce** quickly using **materials, equipment, and labour available in low and middle-income regions**, are **easy to reuse**, and are **comfortable** enough to be worn for extended periods by healthcare workers without inducing pain or discomfort. This effort has yielded **HappyShield**, which successfully meets these design goals. The features of the HappyShield design are listed below:

---

## Features

---

* Single-sheet fluid-impermeable design with **extra protection from fluids and sprays from above**.   

---

* Easy **decontamination for reuse** over high numbers of shifts.   

---

* Form-fitting and adjustable shape allowing for **comfortable wearing for extended periods**.   

---

* **Fast, flexible and scaleable mass-manufacturing approaches** to help meet global demand despite supply chain disruptions.
